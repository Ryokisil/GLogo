# CLAUDE.md Documentation Update

## Added Section: API Reference & Documentation

### Location
- Inserted after "Key Features" and before "Build and Test" in Development Commands section
- Strategic placement to establish documentation standards before development workflows

### Content Added
**Primary Sources for Implementation**:
- Apple Developer Documentation with GLogo-specific focus areas:
  - Core Image: Custom filter implementation and performance optimization
  - Core Graphics: Advanced rendering and coordinate system management  
  - SwiftUI + UIKit: Hybrid architecture integration patterns
  - Photos Framework: PHPhotoLibrary permission handling and asset management
- Swift Evolution: Language feature updates for Swift 6.0+ compliance
- iOS Release Notes: Version-specific API changes and deprecations
- WWDC Session Videos: Advanced techniques for professional app development

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- API availability verification for iOS 15.0+ target
- Framework compatibility across iOS versions
- Official sample code referencing for complex integrations
- Memory management pattern validation with official docs
- WebFetch tool usage for accessing current Apple documentation

### Rationale
1. **Swift Information Scarcity**: Addresses limited web information for iOS development
2. **API Accuracy**: Ensures current and correct API usage patterns
3. **Version Compatibility**: Critical for iOS 15.0+ deployment target
4. **Framework Integration**: Especially important for Core Image/Graphics custom implementations
5. **Memory Management**: Validates official patterns for leak prevention

### Impact
- Improved implementation accuracy through authoritative sources
- Reduced API-related bugs and compatibility issues
- Better alignment with Apple's recommended practices
- Enhanced code quality for professional-grade app development
